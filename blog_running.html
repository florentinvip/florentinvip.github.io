		<h1>Running as meditation</h1>
	</div>

<p>
Running has been the only sport I am able to consistently do.<br/>
I tried many sport activities along the years trying to keep myself at least averagely fit.<br/>
I went to the gym for several months in a row and then I suddenly stopped when something [which seemed] more important popped up in my life.<br/>
And then I tried it at home, lifting weights for a while. And again, after some months, I stopped.<br/>
Then I blamed the lack of equipment and I bought an "all-in-one fitness machine". I used it for a while and then again, I stopped.<br/>
And the story goes on for years. Failure after failure, I was doing weight lifting on a very chaotic basis.
</p>
<p>
But somehow, the running was always there. Maybe I didn't run on a Swiss-precision schedule but it was always easier for me to pick-up the running from where I left it and just continue.<br/>
Everything else is boring [for me]. Gym is extremely boring. Do 10 reps of this, pause, do 10 reps of that, pause, and so on.
In between all these sets of reps, I got lost many times.<br/>
I have a busy mind and it's enough to get a 40 seconds pause between the reps and Iâ€™d be lost in my own thoughts and day dreams. Then I "wake up" 10 minutes later and I realise that I lost all the momentum and I don't feel like continuing the session.<br/>
There is only one thing that helps a bit: listening to loud dynamic music. ("Eminem - 'Till I collapse" is a special treat.) That scares my thoughts away and I can continue pumping iron for longer.
</p>
<p>
Running is a different story.<br/>
I know many people who hate running and they tell me it's boring.<br/>
For me it's the opposite and for long time I was not aware that I actually enjoy running. And joy was the real reason why running was the only sport that was appealing to me.<br/>
When I run, I don't even need the music. Music only disturbs me.<br/>
I breath in, breath out, count the steps between the gasps. Check the heart rate on the watch. Uh, it is too elevated. Slow down a bit and then, after a few minutes, increase the rhythm again.<br/>
There is so much to do when running.<br/>
I know, for haters, running is just a chore. But for me, I realised, it is a sort of meditation because my whole attention is focused on my body, on my senses, on my breathing. And I am finally living in the present moment.<br/>
My thoughts, my obsessions, my negative feelings don't have room in my mind when I run. It's just breath in, breath out and counting. Simple things. Basic. Almost binary.
</p>
<p>
And when I finish the run, I am exhausted and there is only peace and satisfaction in my mind. Pure peace. And a big grin on my face because I feel I accomplished something.<br/>
I silently congratulate myself for another good run and my sport watch completes the congratulations offering me badges of good behaviour almost every time I run.
</p>
<p>
And for a long time I thought that this way of seeing running is uncommon but then I read what Tiberiu Useriu once said and I understood that I am not a singular case.<br/>
He said:<br/>
"I don't like running with music because I feel I lose a lot of what's going on around me. Plus, it messes up my rhythm.<br/>
Even if you keep repeating them, I don't think someone's thoughts are trivial. You can always find a better solution, a unique one, a new angle on your dilemmas, depending a lot on the context in which you're mashing them up. This repetitive thought can be surprisingly helpful in your subsequent decisions."<br/>
